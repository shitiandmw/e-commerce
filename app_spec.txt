E-commerce Admin & Content Platform Specification

Build a production-ready operations backend and admin console for the existing Medusa-based e-commerce project.
This is an enhancement project on top of the current codebase, not a rewrite.
The system should support content operations, merchandising, and storefront-facing content delivery for a cigar-focused commerce site.


Project Context and Constraints

- Existing backend: Medusa v2 (`@medusajs/medusa` 2.13.1), custom modules under `src/modules`
- Existing admin frontend: Next.js 14 app under `admin-ui`
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache/queue: Redis
- Built-in Medusa admin is disabled; custom admin-ui must remain the primary admin experience
- Keep current startup pattern:
  - Backend on port 9000
  - Admin UI on port 3002
  - Docker Compose for PostgreSQL + Redis
- Preserve existing route contracts where possible; avoid breaking changes to already used admin endpoints


Current Implemented Baseline (Must Be Preserved)

Custom modules already exist:
- Brand
- Tag
- Page
- Announcement
- Popup
- Banner (slot + item)
- Article (article + category)
- Curated Collection (collection + tab + item)
- Menu (menu + menu item tree)

Admin APIs already exist for:
- `/admin/brands`, `/admin/tags`, `/admin/pages`, `/admin/announcements`, `/admin/popups`
- `/admin/banner-slots`, `/admin/banner-items`
- `/admin/articles`, `/admin/article-categories`
- `/admin/curated-collections`, nested tabs/items
- `/admin/menus`, nested items/reorder
- `/admin/uploads` (list local uploaded files)

Admin UI already includes pages/modules for:
- products, brands, tags, articles, collections, banners, menus, pages
- announcements, popups, media, orders, customers, inventory
- promotions, shipping, analytics, settings


Primary Goal

Turn the current baseline into a complete content + merchandising platform that can:
1) be operated entirely from admin-ui,
2) expose stable storefront APIs for content rendering,
3) support multi-language content workflows,
4) support SEO configuration across key content entities.


Feature Requirements

P0 - Business-Critical Closed Loop

1. Article/Blog Management
- Full CRUD for articles and article categories
- Fields: title, slug, cover image, summary, rich text content, status, publish time, pin/sort, category
- List supports search/filter/pagination/sort
- Rich text supports embedded links and media references
- Category management with ordering

2. Banner and Slot Management
- CRUD for banner slots (position definitions)
- CRUD for banner items under slots
- Fields: image, title, subtitle, link, sort order, enabled state, active time range
- Frontend consumption should respect enabled state + schedule window + sort order

3. Curated Collection Management
- CRUD for curated collections
- Optional tab grouping under each collection
- Add/remove/reorder product items in collection
- Support product search while adding items
- Support section key for deterministic storefront placement

4. Navigation Menu Management

- Tree-based menu item editing (parent-child)
- Drag/reorder behavior
- Fields: label, link, icon/image, enabled state, metadata
- Output structure should be directly consumable by storefront navigation

5. Storefront Content Delivery APIs (Critical Gap to Complete)
- Implement public store APIs for content modules (currently mostly admin-only)
- Must support locale parameter and publish-status filtering
- Must return normalized payloads for frontend rendering without extra joins on client side


P1 - Operations and Growth

6. Static Page Management
- CRUD for static pages
- Template support (about, terms, privacy, FAQ, shipping-policy, returns, quality)
- Slug uniqueness and publish-state control

7. Announcement Bar Management
- CRUD for announcements
- Fields: text, link, sort order, enabled, active window
- Storefront API returns active announcements only by default

8. Popup Management
- CRUD for popups
- Fields: image, title, description, CTA text/link, enabled
- Trigger settings: first visit, every visit, specific page
- Frequency settings: once, once per session, once per day

9. Product Brand/Tag Association
- Keep product-brand and product-tag linking workflows stable
- Product editor supports selecting brand and multiple tags
- Tag types support badge/attribute use cases

10. Media Library
- Keep upload/list/delete workflow stable
- Continue supporting local static storage listing via `/admin/uploads`
- Ensure predictable URL generation and pagination


P2 - Experience and Scalability

11. Multi-language Content Management
- Target locales: `zh-HK`, `zh-CN`, `en`
- Current baseline has admin language switching (`zh-CN`/`en`), but content fields are mostly single-language
- Add multi-language content storage and editing workflow for:
  - Product core copy (title/subtitle/description)
  - Article (title/summary/content)
  - Static page (title/content)
  - Optional: banner text, popup text, announcement text
- Admin forms should provide locale tabs and fallback behavior

12. SEO Management Expansion
- Current baseline has SEO editor in product form
- Expand SEO support to articles and pages
- Required SEO fields: meta title, meta description, og image, keywords
- Support default auto-generation from content with manual override

13. Analytics and Import/Export Hardening
- Keep current dashboard analytics page
- Improve data completeness and consistency for key stats
- Keep import/export capability stable and predictable for operations usage


Data Model Requirements

Existing entities to keep:
- brand
- custom_tag
- page
- announcement
- popup
- banner_slot
- banner_item
- article
- article_category
- curated_collection
- collection_tab
- collection_item
- menu
- menu_item

Required model enhancements:
1) Multi-language data
- Add `translations` JSONB (or equivalent structured relation) to content-heavy entities
- Recommended shape:
  - `translations.zh-HK`
  - `translations.zh-CN`
  - `translations.en`
- Each locale node may include title/subtitle/summary/content fields based on entity type

2) SEO data normalization
- Add `seo` JSONB (or equivalent fields) for article and page entities
- Product SEO remains in `metadata.seo`, but should follow the same shape for consistency

3) Publication consistency
- Standardize publish fields where relevant:
  - `status` (`draft` / `published`)
  - `published_at`
  - `is_enabled`
  - `starts_at` / `ends_at`


API Requirements

Admin APIs (existing pattern to preserve):
- Continue using current admin route structure and auth model
- Keep support for list + detail + create + update + delete
- Keep validation via `middlewares.ts` + zod validators

New Store APIs to add (public consumption):
- `GET /store/content/home`
  - returns active banners, active announcements, active popups, curated collections snapshot
- `GET /store/content/menus`
  - query: `key`, `locale`
  - returns menu tree ready for rendering
- `GET /store/content/articles`
  - query: `category`, `q`, `offset`, `limit`, `locale`
- `GET /store/content/articles/:slug`
- `GET /store/content/pages/:slug`
- `GET /store/content/collections`
  - query: `key`, `locale`

API behavior expectations:
- Pagination on list endpoints
- Locale fallback logic (requested locale -> default locale)
- Time-window filtering for scheduled content
- Consistent error format and HTTP status handling


Admin UI Requirements

General:
- Keep current dashboard IA and route layout
- Continue using React Query + form validation approach already in place
- Keep rich text editing and media picker integration

Required upgrades:
1) Add locale tabs in content forms (where multi-language is enabled)
2) Add SEO editor to article/page forms (same interaction model as product SEO)
3) Improve list pages with consistent filter/search/pagination UX across modules
4) Keep sticky save actions and validation messages for operational efficiency


Operational Workflows

Content publishing workflow:
1. Create content in draft
2. Fill localized fields and SEO fields
3. Attach media and set schedule
4. Publish
5. Validate via store API payload

Homepage operations workflow:
1. Configure banners by slot and schedule
2. Configure curated collections/tabs/items
3. Configure announcements and popups
4. Validate effective content by locale through `/store/content/home`

Navigation workflow:
1. Build menu tree in admin
2. Reorder and enable/disable nodes
3. Validate storefront rendering using `/store/content/menus`


Implementation Phases

Phase 1 - Stabilize Existing Baseline
- Audit existing module behavior and fix critical defects
- Ensure P0 module CRUD and sort/order behavior is reliable
- Add/complete tests for core workflows

Phase 2 - Storefront API Completion
- Implement and validate all store content endpoints
- Add locale and schedule-aware filtering
- Align payload contracts with storefront consumption needs

Phase 3 - Multi-language + SEO Expansion
